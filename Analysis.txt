This set up featured two computers seperated over a great distance. The first computer was in the CE Dept, it was accessed using the ssh protocol from the main desktop that also acted as the client.

Tcp analaysis:
The session between the server computer and this computer begins on packet 153.

2)
a) Packets 463-525 are the large message, making 62 packets involved in the transmissons, however, only packets 468, 480, 481 & 501 are the packets that carry data from the client directly contianing the data to send. 

b) It performed 4 reads
c) the number of read calls is the same as the number of packets, because the way select works is it only reads if it sees that there is data avaible.
3) The server doesn't need a maximum buffer size, because the server only needs to respond to what the client sends at it, hence it doesn't intend to send anything more than what the client sends at it.
Packets 2542-2553 are the small message small message

UDP analysis:
Session begins on packet 778

2) 
a) 1, packet 3855
b) 1

3)
a) I see 4 packets, packets 4111-41114, this is because the message exceeded the size of the maximum buffer so the OS and the network broke it down to 3 ipv4 packets and one UDP packet, and then sent each indivdually over the network. 

b) 1
c) yes because as IPV4 packets, that have a flag that lets the computer know it needs to be reasssembled. Once the last packet has been recieved the computer then reassembles them into a single message that is than read.
